## Middleware and Static Export Conflict Resolution

The error occurred because Next.js doesn't support using middleware with static export (`output: 'export'`). This is because:

1. Static export generates static HTML files at build time
2. Middleware requires a server to run and modify requests/responses at runtime

### Solution Applied
We removed the `output: 'export'` configuration to enable server-side rendering, which allows the middleware to function properly. This means the application will now:

- Run as a server-side application
- Support the security headers added by the middleware
- Require a Node.js server to run (can't be deployed as purely static files)

If you need static file hosting, you would need to either:
1. Remove the middleware and keep `output: 'export'`, implementing security headers through your static file host
2. Use a hosting platform that supports Next.js server-side rendering (like Vercel)
